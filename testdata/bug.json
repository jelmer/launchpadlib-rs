This is a bug which Ubuntu and other projects are meant to fix. As the philosophy of the Ubuntu Project states, \"Our work is driven by a belief that software should be free and accessible to all.\"\n\n\"Ubuntu software is free. Always was, always will be. Free software gives everyone the freedom to use it however they want and share with whoever they like. This freedom has huge benefits. At one end of the spectrum it enables the Ubuntu community to grow and share its collective experience and expertise to continually improve all things Ubuntu. At the other, we are able to give access to essential software for those who couldn\u2019t otherwise afford it \u2013 an advantage that\u2019s keenly felt by individuals and organisations all over the world.\"\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0* http://www.ubuntu.com/project/about-ubuntu/our-philosophy\n\nNon-free software leaves users at the mercy of the software owner and concentrates control over the technology which powers our society into the hands of a few. Additionally, proprietary software stifles innovation, maintains artificial scarcities, and enables malicious anti-features such as DRM, surveillance, and other monopolistic practices.\n\nThis bug is widely evident in the PC industry.\n\nSteps to repeat:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a01. Visit a local PC store.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a02. Attempt to buy a machine without any proprietary software.\n\nWhat happens:\n\nAlmost always, a majority of PCs for sale have Microsoft Windows pre-installed. In the rare cases that they come with a GNU/Linux operating system or no operating system at all, the drivers and BIOS may be proprietary.\n\nWhat should happen:\n\nA majority of the PCs for sale should include only free software.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0* http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0* http://www.debian.org/social_contract#guidelines\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0* http://www.opensource.org/docs/osd", "owner_link": "https://api.launchpad.net/1.0/~sabdfl", "bug_tasks_collection_link": "https://api.launchpad.net/1.0/bugs/1/bug_tasks", "duplicate_of_link": null, "date_created": "2004-08-20T00:00:00+00:00", "activity_collection_link": "https://api.launchpad.net/1.0/bugs/1/activity", "can_expire": false, "subscriptions_collection_link": "https://api.launchpad.net/1.0/bugs/1/subscriptions", "date_last_updated": "2023-11-04T19:13:03.379889+00:00", "who_made_private_link": null, "date_made_private": null, "heat": 10688, "bug_watches_collection_link": "https://api.launchpad.net/1.0/bugs/1/bug_watches", "cves_collection_link": "https://api.launchpad.net/1.0/bugs/1/cves", "vulnerabilities_collection_link": "https://api.launchpad.net/1.0/bugs/1/vulnerabilities", "duplicates_collection_link": "https://api.launchpad.net/1.0/bugs/1/duplicates", "attachments_collection_link": "https://api.launchpad.net/1.0/bugs/1/attachments", "security_related": false, "latest_patch_uploaded": null, "tags": ["canonical", "eoan", "iso-testing", "jammy", "kinetic", "lunar", "mantic", "microsoft", "noble", "package-qa-testing", "ville"], "date_last_message": "2022-11-18T05:16:58.649512+00:00", "number_of_duplicates": 0, "message_count": 1970, "users_affected_count": 2469, "users_unaffected_count": 72, "users_affected_collection_link": "https://api.launchpad.net/1.0/bugs/1/users_affected", "users_unaffected_collection_link": "https://api.launchpad.net/1.0/bugs/1/users_unaffected", "users_affected_count_with_dupes": 2469, "other_users_affected_count_with_dupes": 2469, "users_affected_with_dupes_collection_link": "https://api.launchpad.net/1.0/bugs/1/users_affected_with_dupes", "messages_collection_link": "https://api.launchpad.net/1.0/bugs/1/messages", "linked_branches_collection_link": "https://api.launchpad.net/1.0/bugs/1/linked_branches", "http_etag": "\"e366b417b1c47ac9ce593b7c89de7359b966d244-d1d25ae0217c8923db5142d6b739552ba2b1f09a\""}
